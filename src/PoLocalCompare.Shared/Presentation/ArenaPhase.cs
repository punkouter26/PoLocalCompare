/// <para>
/// Nine flags describe 2^9 combinations; the page has thirteen states. Most of that space was
/// unreachable, but nothing said which parts, and the arms that kept it consistent did so by
/// ORDER rather than by construction — the same trap already documented on Home's
/// <c>CompareHint</c>, where checking the arms in the obvious sequence told a user who had
/// picked two models that they had picked none. Ordering is a property you cannot test and
/// cannot see; an enum is both.

/// It lives in Shared rather than beside the page for the reason CLAUDE.md gives: the Unit
/// tier references only the Api project, so anything pure under <c>PoLocalCompare.Client/</c>
/// is reachable by no suite except E2E-UI, which CI never runs. A resolver that is a pure
/// function of thirteen inputs is exactly the shape that wants a table test.

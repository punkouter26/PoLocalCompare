/// Streaming telemetry for one side of a duel. Both sides of the Arena used to carry the
/// same five parallel fields (<c>_leftStatus</c> / <c>_rightStatus</c>, etc.) — a row of
/// declarations that took 10 lines, plus a dozen update sites that wrote one side or the
/// other based on a <c>Side == "Left"</c> branch. Grouping the fields per side shrinks the
/// declaration and lets an update site pick its side with a single index.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Mutable by design: status updates arrive many times per second and a per-update
/// allocation would be churn for nothing. The browser-model bookkeeping lives here too:
/// it used to be a second row of <c>_leftXxx</c> / <c>_rightXxx</c> fields on the Arena
/// beside this class, which kept the local status handler as two copy-pasted branches.

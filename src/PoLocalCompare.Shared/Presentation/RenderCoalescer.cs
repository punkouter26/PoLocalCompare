/// <remarks>
/// The Arena re-rendered once per token batch. Every one of those renders walked the whole page
/// — two sandboxed iframes, the scorecard, the telemetry HUD — to move a token counter, and a
/// fast remote model emits batches far quicker than a frame. <see cref="Request"/> is therefore
/// trailing-edge: the first call schedules a render one interval out and every call inside that
/// window is free, so N updates in an interval cost exactly one render instead of N.
///
/// Terminal events (a duel completing, a verdict landing) call <see cref="FlushAsync"/> instead,
/// which paints immediately — waiting out an interval to show a final result would be a visible
/// lag on the one frame that matters.
///
/// Lives in Shared rather than beside the Arena so it is reachable from the Unit tier; anything
/// under Client/ can only be tested by E2E-UI, which CI never runs.

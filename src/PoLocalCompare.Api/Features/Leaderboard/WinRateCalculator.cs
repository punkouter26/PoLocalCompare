/// Win rate is <c>WinCount / DuelCount</c> — judged draws are not wins, so a model that drew
/// every duel shows 0% even though its W/L/T reads 0/0/N. A model that never competed shows
/// 0 (not NaN) so the column renders cleanly. Lives in <c>Common/Domain</c> because the
/// <see cref="GetLeaderboardHandler"/> projection was silently dropping the field (the
/// <c>LeaderboardEntryDto.WinRate</c> property stayed at its C# default of 0) and that bug
/// recurred every time the handler was edited — a named, unit-tested helper pins the
/// behaviour so the next refactor can't quietly remove it again.

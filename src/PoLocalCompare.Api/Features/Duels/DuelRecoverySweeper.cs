/// <summary>
/// Settles duels the process died in the middle of.

/// <remarks>
/// Everything a duel needs to finish — the background queue slot, the hub groups, the in-memory
/// inference tasks — dies with the process. Nothing used to look at the leftovers: a duel that
/// was mid-flight at shutdown stayed <see cref="DuelVerdict.Pending"/> forever, the Arena showed
/// it with live winner buttons (and — before the verdict guard existed — accepted votes on it),
/// and the lobby counted it as awaiting judgment until the storage was wiped.
///
/// Two shapes of leftover exist, and each gets the honest ending:
///
/// • Both result rows present — execution actually finished, only the judge (or the completion
///   write) was cut off. The completion timestamp is stamped and the auto-judge is run inline,
///   which resolves the duel exactly as it would have before the restart: walkover, tie, judge
///   decision, or void.
///
/// • Any result row missing — inference never finished and nothing will ever finish it. The
///   duel is voided: terminal, banks nothing, drops out of every awaiting-judgment projection.
///
/// Runs at startup in every environment — an App Service restart is the production case, and it
/// is exactly the case where duels are most likely to have been mid-flight (deployments).
/// Scoped to the current and previous month partitions: a duel older than that predates any
/// plausible restart and has already been settled by an earlier sweep.
